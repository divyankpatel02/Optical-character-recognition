ocr reliability is higher when using a 
monospaced font than a proportional 
font since the separation of 
proportional characters would be 
harder and that is the reason why i 
used this fort 

this image is the input to the ocr 
which will then be converted to a txt 
file 

here am testing all small letters from 
a to z 
abcdefghijklmropqrstuvwxyz 

my ocr orly works for this fort of 
size twerty ard numbers and capital 
letters are not yet trained 

thank you for reading all the way till 
here and am sorry for not using commas 
and periods since my neural net is not 
trained on them yet
